Mufti Gallery — Static Demo Website

Files created:
- `index.html` — Landing page with featured items and merged shop/about (no cart)
- `css/styles.css` — Styles
- `js/app.js` — Client-side logic (loads `data/products.json`)
- `data/products.json` — Sample product data

How to run locally:
- Option A: Open `index.html` in your browser (works for basic demo).
- Option B: Serve with a simple static server (recommended for `fetch`):

  Python 3:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Teqnyat - تقنيات\OneDrive\Desktop\mufti"
python -m http.server 8000; # then open http://localhost:8000
```

What I still need from you:
- High-resolution images for products (optional)
- Exact store text: shipping policy, contact email, phone, address
- Preferred colors, logo, and any brand assets

Next steps I can take (pick one):
- Add real contact form with server or Netlify Forms
- Integrate a lightweight CMS or admin edit page
- Create product pages for SEO and richer descriptions

Tell me which next step you want, and share images/text if you have them.
